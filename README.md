You need to keep interacting with the community, liking their pics in order to get recognized and expose your feed to others.

For that, there's AutoFeedLiker. This is a bot that will keep running and liking your instagram feed (comprising of pictures of people you follow).

Hopefully, you'll get more followers, increasing viewers of your feed.
