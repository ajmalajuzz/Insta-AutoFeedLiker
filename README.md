# Insta-AutoFeedLiker
This is a bot to autolike your instagram feed

Everyone knows getting followers on instagram is a tough job. 
You need to keep interacting with the community, liking their pics in order to get recognized and expose your feed to others.
But well, liking pictures is a boring job. Maybe they've uploaded cat pics that you don't really like, but you still want that user to come see your feed.

For that, there's AutoFeedLiker. This is a bot that will keep running and liking your instagram feed (comprising of pictures of people you follow).

Hopefully, you'll get more followers, increasing viewers of your feed.
Keep reading to know how to get it up and going.

########################################################################################################################
First off, you need to head over to www.instagram.com/developer

1) Read simple instructions here -> http://www.slickremix.com/docs/how-to-create-instagram-access-token/
   In addition to that, click on "Edit" after you've saved a client. Goto security, and untick "Disable implicit OAuth".
   We are doing that because we are going to implicitly call the APIs (without providing password everytime)

2) Watch the 2 min video, if step#1 is not clear -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkuJtIcXR68

3) Save the access token in config.txt file as:-

   access_token=newly generated token

   for ex:
   access_token=575199251.7in678i.g23atb436f6ba0fs8gi587f6a4esdcg3

   We need this access token to make requests to instagram.

4) And that's it, download the executable instaAutoLike.exe

5) Place config.txt in the same folder as executable

6) Double click the .exe file, sit back, grab a beer, and let the script do its work.

The bot will autolike all your images in your feed.
Enjoy! :)
